In ([[Anand]] et al., 2013), an orchestrated survey on the most prominent techniques for automatic test case generation was conducted, in which SBST is included. The survey focuses on several SBST emerging areas including: (i) the combination of SBST with other techniques â€“ e.g., [[dynamic symbolic]] execution; (ii) the [[oracle]] problem; (iii) the [[co-evolutionary computation]] paradigm; (iv) the use of [[hyper-heuristics]] to combine different SE activities; and (v) the optimisation and better understanding of failures.
