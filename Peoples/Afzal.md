The work proposed in ([[Afzal]] et al., 2009) builds on on [[McMinn]]â€™s research ([[McMinn]], 2004) and presented a review on how search-based techniques are used to test non-functional properties of the software, focusing on: the properties studied, the [[fitness functions]] implemented and the constraints and limitations found when testing each property. The set of non-functional properties identified include (listed in descending order of the number of papers that investigate it): execution time, security, usability, safety and quality of service.
