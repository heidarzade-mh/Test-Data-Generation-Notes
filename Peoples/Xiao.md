[[Xiao]] et al. reported the experimental results regarding the effectiveness of five different optimisation techniques over five different C/C++ programs (Xiao et al., 2007). The results show that the [GA](obsidian://open?vault=Thesis&file=Genetic%20Algorithm)-based approach outperformed the remaining techniques – e.g., [[Simulated Annealing]] (SA), [[Genetic Simulated Annealing]] (GSA), [[Simulated Annealing with Advanced Adaptive Neighborhood]] (SA/ANN) and [[Random Testing]] – achieving the best overall performance.
