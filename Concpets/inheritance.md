OO programming allows classes to inherit commonly used state and behaviour from other classes. Inheritance expresses this similarity between classes by using the concept of base classes and derived classes: a base class contains all of the characteristics and behaviours that are shared among the classes derived from it. Semantically, inheritance denotes an “is a” relationship; inheritance thus implies a generalization/specialization hierarchy, wherein a subclass specialises the more general structure or behaviour of its superclass.
