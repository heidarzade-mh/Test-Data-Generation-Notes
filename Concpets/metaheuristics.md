Computing optimal solutions for many problems of industrial and scientific importance is often difficult and sometimes impossible; automating the test data generation process is a paradigmatic example. Unlike exact methods, metaheuristics allow solving hard and complex problem instances by delivering satisfactory solutions in a reasonable time.
