[Genetic Algorithms](obsidian://open?vault=Thesis&file=Concpets%2FGenetic%20Algorithm) (GAs) are the most well-known form of [[Evolutionary Algorithms]]. ([[Holland]], 1962)

The term “Genetic Algorithm” comes from the analogy between the encoding of candidate solutions as a sequence of simple components and the genetic structure of a chromosome. Like other Evolutionary Algorithms, GAs are based on the notion of competition: they maintain a population of solutions rather than just one current solution. In consequence, the search is afforded many starting points, and the chance to sample more of the search space than local searches. The population is iteratively recombined and mutated to evolve successive populations, known as generations. Various selection mechanisms can be used to decide which individuals should be used to create offspring for the next generation. Key to this is the concept of the [fitness](obsidian://open?vault=Thesis&file=Concpets%2Ffitness%20functions) of individuals – the idea of selection is to favour the fitter individuals, in the hope of breeding better offspring.
