Polymorphism means “different forms” and it represents a concept in type theory in which a single name (such as a variable declaration) may denote objects of many different classes that are related by a common superclass. Any object denoted by this name is therefore able to respond to some common set of operations; distinction is expressed through differences in behaviour of the methods that can be called through the base class.
