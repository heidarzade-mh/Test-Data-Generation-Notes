Hiding internal state and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object’s methods is known as data encapsulation – a fundamental principle of OO programming. The most important reason underlying the usage of encapsulation is that of separating the interface from the implementation ([[Eckel]], 2002); this allows establishing boundaries within a data type and hiding its internal mechanism, and prevents client programmers from accidentally treating the internals of an object as part of the interface that they should be using.
